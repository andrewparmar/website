It's deadlines that create the fire under your butt.

We can have all the intentions in the world to do something, but nothing will get you more motivated than a deadline—an actual time and place in space where you will either deliver or fail. Also, the more public the potential humiliation, the greater your drive to succeed.

## Use it to your advantage
Is there something you want to accomplish, something that you have been putting off for a while?  
Put yourself in a position where you cannot back out of a public display of your work—or lack thereof.
