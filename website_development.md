# Website Development

Development notes detailing my process of building my personal website.

Goal: A simple site showcasing articles developed in Markdown.

## Tech Stack
- NextJS
    - I've been going through the NextJS tutorial for work, and it seems like a good choice for building out a static site.
- Github
    - I've wanted to try out Github's site hosting feature. If I have a static site generated with NextJS, having it deployed via Github pages would be the simplest approach.
- Markdown
    - I want my base articles to be in Markdown. This will act as a primitve content managment system. I don't want to spend too much time on CSS while starting off.

# Development
Create a new Github repo - I'm just choosing to call it `website`, and clone.

Need to create a NextJS app. Using the recomended approach here https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation
